# about_PoShaKucha



**PoShaKucha** is a portmanteau (a combination) word derived from the term "PoSh" (for PowerShell) and "Pecha Kucha". A [Pecha Kucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha) is an entertaining storytelling format, in which 20 images/slides are shown for 20 seconds each. A Pecha Kucha presentation will therefore always last 6 min 40 sec (plus or minus a few seconds), this also applies to a PoshaKucha.
